## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We're creating a blog for our client.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user needs to install these files in a location that can serve up HTML, CSS, and JS files. They need to use a browser envirnoment that is compatible with the aformentioned languages and can access these files. They also need to have internet connection to access the jQuery library at code.jquery.com.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The languages we use in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript. We also use the jQuery library.
